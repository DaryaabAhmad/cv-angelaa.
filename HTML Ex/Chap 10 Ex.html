    <h1>From Garden to Plate
        
    </h1>    
    <p>A <i>potager</i> is a French term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen garden. Oftern flowers 9edible and
        non-edible) and herbs are planted with the vegetables to enhance the garden's beauty. the goal is to make the
        funtion of providing food aesthetically pleasing. </p>
    <h2>What to Plant</h2>
    <p>Plants are chosen as much for their functionality
        as for their color and form. many are trained to grow upward. A well-dessigned potager can provide food, cut
        flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance. potagers can disguise their function of providing
        for a home in a wide arary of foems - from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the fomaility of a knot
        garden. </p>
